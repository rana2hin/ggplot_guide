    "text": "üòä Before We Start\nIn December 2017, after completing my first year of statistics, I delved into learning R. Having a background in Java, C, and C++ coding since high school, I enjoyed R but found its plots not so appealing and the code a bit tricky. On a quest for something beautiful and user-friendly, I stumbled upon a blog titled Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet by Zev Ross, last updated in January 2016. Intrigued, I decided to follow the tutorial step by step, learning a great deal. As time passed, I tweaked and expanded the codes, adding new chart types and resources.\nRealizing that Zev Ross‚Äôs blog hadn‚Äôt been updated for years, I took the initiative to create my own version, incorporating updates like the amazing {patchwork}, {ggtext}, and {ggforce} packages. I also shared insights on custom fonts, colors, and introduced a variety of R packages for interactive charts. The journey led to a unique tutorial, and now, I‚Äôve decided to make it public, adding even more updates, such as Maps! because who doesn‚Äôt love maps!!\nI incorporated the following enhancements into my tutorial:",
