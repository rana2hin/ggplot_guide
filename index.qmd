# Before We Start {.unnumbered}

In December 2017, after completing my first year of statistics, I delved into learning R. Having a background in `Java`, `C`, and `C++` coding since high school, I enjoyed R but found its plots not so appealing and the code a bit tricky. On a quest for something beautiful and user-friendly, I stumbled upon a blog titled [**Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet**](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/) by [Zev Ross](https://twitter.com/zevross), last updated in January 2016. Intrigued, I decided to follow the tutorial step by step, learning a great deal. As time passed, I tweaked and expanded the codes, adding new chart types and resources.

Realizing that Zev Ross's blog hadn't been updated for years, I took the initiative to create my own version, incorporating updates like the amazing `{patchwork}`, `{ggtext}`, and `{ggforce}` packages. I also shared insights on custom fonts, colors, and introduced a variety of R packages for interactive charts. The journey led to a unique tutorial, and now, I've decided to make it public, adding even more updates, such as Maps! because who doesn't love maps!!

I incorporated the following enhancements into my tutorial:

*   Following the R style guide (e.g., by [Hadley Wickham](https://style.tidyverse.org), [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), or the [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/04/25/etiquette.html#syntax) style guides).
*   Implementing changes to the style and aesthetics of plots, including axis titles, legends, and color schemes for all plots.
*   Ensuring that the tutorial remains up-to-date with changes in `{ggplot2}` (current version: 3.4.0).
*   Modifying data import methods to utilize GitHub as a data source.
*   Offering additional tips on various topics such as chart selection, color palettes, title modifications, adding lines, adjusting legends, annotations with labels, arrows and boxes, multi-panel plots, Geospatial Visualizations and interactive visualizations. ...
