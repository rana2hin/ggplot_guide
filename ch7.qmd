To modify the overall appearance of your plot, you can use various functions. While altering the entire theme of your plot is one option (covered in detail in the ["Working with Themes"](#themes) section below), you can also make specific changes to individual elements such as backgrounds and grid lines.

## Change the Panel Background Color

You can adjust the background color (fill) of the panel area (where the data is plotted) by modifying the theme element `panel.background`:

```{r panel-color}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "#1D8565", size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(
    fill = "#64D2AA", color = "#64D2AA", linewidth = 2)
  )
```

Keep in mind that the true color — the outline of the panel background — didn't change despite our specification. This is because there's a layer on top of `panel.background`, namely `panel.border`. However, it's important to use a transparent fill here; otherwise, your data will be hidden behind this layer. In the following example, I illustrate this by using a semitransparent hex color for the `fill` argument in `element_rect`:

```{r panel-color-2}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "#1D8565", size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(
    fill = "#64D2AA99", color = "#64D2AA", linewidth = 2)
  )
```

## Change Grid Lines

There are two types of grid lines: major grid lines indicating the ticks and minor grid lines between the major ones. You can customize both by overwriting the defaults for `panel.grid` or for each set of gridlines separately, `panel.grid.major` and `panel.grid.minor`.

```{r grid-lines}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray10", linewidth = .5),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "gray70", linewidth = .25))
```

You can even specify settings for all four different levels of grid lines: major horizontal, major vertical, minor horizontal, and minor vertical.

```{r grid-lines-x-y}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(linewidth = .5, linetype = "dashed"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(linewidth = .25, linetype = "dotted"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "red1"),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "blue1"),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(color = "red4"),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(color = "blue4"))
```

And, of course, you can remove some or all grid lines if you like. For instance, to remove all grid lines, you can set `panel.grid = element_blank()`. Alternatively, you can remove only major or minor grid lines by specifying `panel.grid.major` or `panel.grid.minor` accordingly and setting them to `element_blank()`.

```{r grid-remove}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

```{r grid-blank}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

## Change Spacing of Gridlines

Furthermore, you can also define the breaks between both major and minor grid lines by specifying the `breaks` argument.

```{r grid-breaks}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10),
                     minor_breaks = seq(0, 100, 2.5))
```

## Change the Plot Background Color

Similarly, to change the background color (fill) of the plot area, you can modify the theme element `plot.background` using the `theme()` function. This allows you to customize the appearance of the entire plot area according to your preferences.

```{r background-color}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray60",
                                       color = "gray30", linewidth = 2))
```

You can achieve a unique background color by either setting the same colors in both `panel.background` and `plot.background` or by setting the background filling of the panel to `"transparent"` or `NA`. This customization can help you create visually appealing plots that match your design preferences.

```{r background-color-same}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray60",
                                       color = "gray30", linewidth = 2))
```
